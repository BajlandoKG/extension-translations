  <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
  <p>Actions works from any Tab, active or background.<br>
    Firefox restricts some functions (e.g. copy/promt/warning) on some URLs. FoxyTab v2.11+ works on all URLs.<br>
    Firefox is changing in preparation for FF57 and there might be unforeseen issues between FF53-57 due to API changes.</p> 
  
  
  <h2 id="how_to">How to Use</h2>
 
  <h3>Tab Counter</h3>
  <p>Toolbar icon with a badge showing the number of opened tabs in all windows. Due to some issues beyond <b>FoxyTab</b>'s control, the number can become inaccurate. Clicking the Toolbar icon will recount the tabs. To preserve resources, Tab Counter will start counting as soon as a new tab is opened or closed. If desired, you can move the Toolbar icon via Customize Toolbar.</p>

  <h3>Duplicate Tab</h3>
  <p>Duplicate tab next to the Tab and make it active</p>
  
  <h3>Close Duplicate Tabs</h3>
  <p>Close all duplicate tabs, ignoring location.hash</p>

  <h3>Close Tabs to the Left</h3>
  <p>Similar to the built-in "Close Tab to the Right", close all Tabs to the left of current tab, warns if there are more than 1 tab to close.<br>New in v2.11: <b>FoxyTab</b> no longer closes the Pinned Tabs, unless <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is pressed.</p>
  
  <h3>Merge All Windows</h3>
  <p>Merge all tabs from all windows into the current window. To preserve security, when merging to/from a Private window, tabs are closed in target window and the same URLs \re opened in the current window. When moving tabs between Private and Normal windows for security reasons, in Firefox, privileged URLs are not moved (e.g. chrome: URLs, javascript: URLs, data: URLs, file: URLs, privileged about: URLs (for example, about:config, about:addons, about:debugging). In other words, when moving tabs between Private and Normal windows, only tabs with URL starting with HTTP/HTTPS/FTP will be moved.</p> 
  
  <h3>Close Other Windows</h3>
  <p>Close all other opened windows.</p>
  
  <h3>Save Tab as PDF</h3>
  <p>Save as PDF is not available on Mac OS X or before Firefox 56.<br>
    I may add some user preferences later.</p> 

  <h3>Create Desktop Shortcut</h3>

  <p>Copy the IP (can be IPv4 or IPv6) of any remote tab, active or not</p>
 
  <h3>Copy URLs</h3>
  <p>Copy single Tab, ALL, To the Left or To the Right</p> 

  <h3>Copy Titles & URLs</h3>
  <p>Copy single Tab, ALL, To the Left or To the Right</p> 

  <h3>Bookmark</h3>
  <p>Bookmark To the Left or To the Right (<i>Firefox already has a Bookmark All Tabs</i>)</p>

      Keep all the tabs from the same host, close others<br>

  </ul>

  <h2 id="theme">Theme</h2> 
  <p><b>Create/Import/Export/Apply your own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Themes/Lightweight_themes">Lightweight Themes</a></b> (Firefox 55+)<br>
  Lightweight themes are made up of a "header" graphic image file, which skins the default Firefox UI background.</p>
  
  <p><b>Creating a Theme Header Image</b><br>
  The header image is displayed as the background of the top of the browser window, nestling in behind the toolbars, address bar, search bar and the tab strip. It will be anchored to the top-right corner of the browser window.</p>
  
  <p><b>Image Requirements</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dimensions should be <b>3000px</b> wide × <b>200px</b> high</li>
    <li>PNG, JPG, APNG, SVG, GIF (animated GIF isn’t supported) or Data:URI file format</li>
    <li>Image must be no larger than 300 KB in file size</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>Tips</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Subtle, soft contrast images and gradients work best; highly detailed images will compete with the browser UI.</li>
    <li>Firefox may reveal more of the lower portion of the image if another toolbar or other UI element is added to the top of the window.</li>
    <li>The upper right-hand side of the image should have the most important information—as a user increases the width of the browser window, the browser reveals more of the left-hand side of the image.</li>
    <li>Ultrawide monitors can run to 3440px wide, to look good on these monitors, either increase the size of the image or ensure the left of the image fades to a solid colour.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Import</h3> 
    <p>Import ready FoxyTab Themes (JSON files), or import an image into the theme that you are making.</p>
    <p>Imported Image will be converted to <code>Data:URI</code> entered in "Header Image" section, if it is empty and if not, in the "Additional Backgrounds" section.</p>  
    <p>FoxyTab Theme manifests can be imported into FoxyTab in the following JSON format, using any available properties listed on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme">MDN theme</a>.<br>
    The main difference is that images must be in Data:URI format. Maximum size allowed for the JSON is set to 500kb.</p>
    <p>The minimum requirements for a theme are "accentcolor" & "textcolor".</p>
