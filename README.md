Public Repository to add Translations to my Extensions

I am changing the procedure by keeping one version for each extension. That would be the **NEXT** version as there is no point in working on the translation of a version that has already been released. 

Please note that the English _messages.json_ may change up to the release date.

I am still experimenting with the format of this repository. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
